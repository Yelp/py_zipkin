    Usage #1: Start a trace with a given sampling rate

    This begins the zipkin trace and also records the root span. The required
    params are service_name, transport_handler, and sample_rate.

            sample_rate=0.05,
        ):
            do_stuff()

    Usage #2: Trace a service call.

    The typical use case is instrumenting a framework like Pyramid or Django. Only
    ss and sr times are recorded for the root span. Required params are
    service_name, zipkin_attrs, transport_handler, and port.

    only required param is service_name. If you're not in a zipkin trace, this
    won't do anything.
